=head1 NAME

Getopt::Auto - Option framework for command-line applications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Getopt::Auto;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Getopt::Auto> provides an easy way to organize a script
to handle whatever option mechanism it requires. 

For each option C<--foo> you provide a subroutine C<sub foo{...}>.
The sub is called every time C<--foo> appears on the command line.
Values for the option are taken from C<@ARGV>.

If you don't provide a subroutine for C<--foo>, then C<$options{'--foo'}>
is set.


=head2 Using Getopt::Auto

=over 4

=item *

In the POD (Plain Old Documentation).

=item *

In the B<use> statement.

=item * 

Forgetaboutit.

=back

=head2 Example

Here's an example I'll reference later.

    use Getopt::Auto;
    our %options;

    $VERSION  = '1.0';
    sub add { $count += shift @ARGV; }
    $count += $options{'--inc'};
    print "Count: $count\n";

    =pod

    =head2 -a, --add - Add integer to count.

    The integer argument is not checked.

    =head2 --inc - Bump count by 1

    =cut

When C<example.pl> is executed,

    example.pl --add 2 --inc -a 3
    Count: 6

=head2 Working from POD

OK, so we're all excellent Perl authors, which means that our scripts have careful
and extensive documentation as POD. In particular all of the options are there.
Just check that the options are described in one of these ways, and you 
can enjoy all of the benefits of C<Getopt::Auto>.

Use C<=head2>, C<=head3>, C<=head4> or C<=item>, thus:

    =head2 -a, --add - Add integer to count.

    The integer argument is not checked.

There are several things to note.

=over 4

=item *
    
I've used C<=head2> in the example.

Wherever I do this, you may
substitute C<=head3>, C<=head4> or C<=item> as you wish. 
    
=item *

Notice the structure of the C<=head2> line. It's important.

To begin, we have the options C<-a> and C<--add>. There are some
options (pun intended) here. Three styles are supported, and they may be
mixed. 

=over 4

=item "long" (C<--gnu-style>)

=item "short" (C<-oldstyle>)

=item "bare" (CVS-style, C<myprogram edit foo.txt>)

=back

What follows the option(s) is 'I<space(s) dash(es) space(s)>'; at a minimum ' - '.
This makes the C<=head2> command into an option registration. Without it, it's 
just another C<=head2>.
The 'dash space' separates the option from the remainder of the line,
which is called the L</Short Help>. If there's just 'I<space dash space>' and nothing
else, then there is no L</Short Help>.

Options may be combined.  For example, C<=head2 -a, --add>.

=item *

Finally, there's the L</Long Help>. There may be one or more paragraphs, or 
there may be none. It's up to you. The L</Long Help> stops at the next POD command.

=back

The L</Short Help> and L</Long Help> are used by the built-in C<--help> option.
See L</Help and Version>.

=head2 use Getopt::Auto([...])

C<Getopt::Auto> can work from lists passed in the B<use> statement.
It expects a reference to a list of lists. Each list consists of four 
elements.

=over 4

=item *

The name of the option, with the requisite leading dashes, if any

=item *

The short help. One line, no newlines

=item *

The long help, paragraphs separated by newlines

=item *

A CODE reference for the subroutine that processes the option

=back

The L</Example> could be coded with no POD.

    use Getopt::Auto([
                      ['--add', 'Add integer to count.', "The integer argument is not checked.
                      ['-a', 'Add integer to count.', undef, \&add],
                      ['--inc','Bump count by 1', undef, undef]
                     ]);

There is no requirement that the CODE reference have the same name
as the option, nor that it be unique. It can also be C<undef>
if you wish only to have C<%options> set.  
The command line is treated the same irrespective of how the 
options are defined.  Please use C<undef> for any list elements you don't need.

You may have multiple [] groupings, and you may also include L</Advanced Options>.
However, you may I<not> use a variable, because a variable won't be assigned at 
the time C<Getopt::Auto::import> is called.

This method can be used in conjunction with L</Working from POD>.

=head2 Forgetaboutit

This feature must be turned on using the 
L</Advanced Usage> configuration option, C<findsub>.

So, you're not so careful about your POD? Or, perhaps its too soon for POD? (Hah!)
Never fear, you're covered. Just provide an option subroutine, or check C<%options>.
This works because when C<Getopt::Auto> comes across what appears to be an option 
while processing the command line, it checks to see if there's a corresponding sub.
If you have a sub whose name is the same as a piece of valid I<data> that may
be entered on the command line, the data will be treated as an option, so be careful.

=head2 Where's the POD?

C<Getopt::Auto> looks for POD in three places, in this order:

=over 4

=item The current file

=item Thie current file with the extension '.pod' substituted for .pm, .pl or .t.

=item The current file with the extension '.`pod' added, if there's no  .pm, .pl or .t.

=back

Scanning stops the first time there is I<any> success. 
This means that you can't split  the C<=head2> POD over files.
Notice that although we talk about C<example.pl>, all of this
works for C<example.pm> as well. Or  C<example.t>, for that matter.

There's a (small) exception to this. Scanning for VERSION 
does not interrupt the scanning for POD. See L</Help and Version>.

It's OK for there to be no POD at all, so there's no error message if,
for example, your foo.pl has no POD and there's no foo.pod.

=head2 What's an Option?

Here's our example, once more.

    =head2 -a, --add - Add integer to count.

    The integer argument is not checked.

C<Getopt::Auto> scans your script (In the C<CHECK> block: see L<perlmod>).
Once the C<=head2> is stripped, we're left with a line of text. 
Some options (C<-a, --add>),
followed by 'I<space(s) dash(es) space(s)>'; at a minimum ' - '.
This makes the C<=head2> command into an option registration. Without it, it's 
just another C<=head2>.
Notice that there are two options here, one short and one long, seperated by a
comma. You can have more than just two. Or just one.

C<Getopt::Auto> checks to see if there's a subroutine in the
current package that is defined for each option. See L</Option Subroutines>.

It's not a requirement that every option have a subroutine.
See L</Options Without Subroutines>.

If, in the example, there's no C<sub a{...}>. In order to simplify things for you,
C<Getopt::Auto> assumes that if you are listing several options under a
single C<=head2>, you probably wish to process them with the same sub.
Hence, any options that don't have a C<sub> are assigned the I<next> one found that does.
C<sub add{...}> in the example.

The 'dash space' separates the option from the remainder of the line,
which is called the L</Short Help>. If there's just 'I<space dash space>' and nothing
else, then there is no L</Short Help>.

=head3 Short Help

The short help is everything on the line after "dash space".
If it's not defined, then this C<=head2> does not describe an option.

=head3 Long Help

The paragraph(s) that follow the C<=head2> up to the 
next POD command are the long help. There may be none.
The long help is copied verbatim from the POD, without formatting.

=head3 Registered Option

Options discovered in POD are referred to as I<registered>,
Options from L</use Getopt::Auto([...])> are also I<registered>.
Otherwise, anything on the command line that I<looks> like an option
will get an error message. These are called I<unregistered> options.

=head2 Option Subroutines

The name of an option subroutine is computed from the name of the option.

=over 4

=item *

Strip leading dashes

=item *

Convert embedded dashes to underscores

=back

C<--foo-bar> expects C<sub foo_bar{...}>.

=head2 Command Line Processing

Now we've scanned the POD and/or included the data from
C</use Getopt::Auto([...])>.
C<Getopt::Auto> sees C<@ARGV> before the program begins execution.
(In the C<INIT> block: see L<perlmod>.)
As it processes the elements, it finds options and executes the 
indicated actions.
The non-option elements are shifted off and retained. 
The processing subroutines may manipulate C<@ARGV> in any way,
but it's expected that they will just shift off their arguments,
which will be the first elements of C<@ARGV>.
When option processing ends, the retained elements are
replaced (unshifted) for the program to see.

So, using L</Example> again, when
C<example.pl --add 2 9999 --inc -a 3 abcd>, 
begins execution, 
it sees C<(9999, abcd)> in C<@ARGV>, 2 and 3 having been shifted off by add().

=head3 Values specified by "="

This would be C<--add=24> rather than C<--add 24>.
If C<Getopt::Auto> encounters this construct, it strips out
the "=" and C<add()> will see "24" in C<$ARGV[0]>.
Note that as this usage provides an argument, there I<must> be a 
subroutine associated with the option.

=head3 Cease and desist

There's a convention in C<@ARGV> processing that uses a bare "--" or "-" to signal 
the end to option processing. C<Getopt::Auto> supports this, and you can use either!

    example.pl --add 2 -- 9999 --inc -a 3 abcd 

leaves C<(9999 --inc -a 3 abcd)> in C<@ARGV>. 
Command-line processing was turned off by the '--' that follows C<--add 2>.

=head3 Execution Order

When coding an option subroutine, take into consideration that it will be
executed in the context of an C<INIT> block. (See L<perlmod>.) A side-effect of this (or the 
intended effect, if you prefer) is that none of what one might see as
"normal" variable initializations are performed.  For example, add this to example.pl:

    my $var = 'abcd';
    sub printvar {
        print "\$var is '$var'\n";
    }

    =head2 --printvar - Print the value of $var

and so,

    example.pl --printvar
    $var is ''

as C<$var> is undefined at that point.

It's easy to get caught by this, especially when converting code from other
option schemes. There are ways to work around the problem.

=over 4

=item Use write-only subroutines

This is general advice for option subroutines. Think of them as write-only. 
In other words, they should not I<read> anything from their environment,
other than C<@ARGV>.
 
=item Use a flag variable

Have foo() set a "foo was called" global (not initialized, of course) and call foo()
(now renamed) at a convenient time. 

=item Don't use a C<sub foo> for C<--foo>

At a convenient time do: C<_foo() if exists $options{'--foo'}>. 

=item Use an C<init> subroutine.

If the L</Configuration> hash has C<init =E<gt> \&your_init_sub>, then C<your_init_sub> will be
called at the in the C<INIT> block I<before> any option processing. Needed initializations
could be performed there. 

=back

=head3 Options Without Subroutines

An option that does not have an associated subroutine
will cause C<$options{'option'}> in the B<use>-ing package to be incremented.
(Please specify "B<our> %options") and note the quotes. The option is inserted in
the C<%options> hash as C<--add> or C<-a>. Omit the quotes and Perl will try to pre-increment
your C<sub add{...}>!

A note about interaction with your code.

=over 4

=item If you say C<our %options>

The hash will be managed as above.

=item If you say nothing

You'll get a C<%main::options> defined for you. If you use C<%options> in other ways, 
that could result in confusion.

=item If you say C<my %options>

C<%main::options> will be assigned as above, and will be accessible (unless you C<use strict>)
until your C<my %options> is executed.

=back


=head3 Mixing Option Styles

C<Getopt::Auto> is tolerant of mixed bare, short and long option styles.
There's one thing to look out for. If you say C<-foo> when you registered C<--foo>,
you will I<not> get a call to sub foo(). Instead, you get the
default processing for short options.

=head3 Short Option Default Processing

If C<-foo> is not L<Registered> 
C<Getopt::Auto> treats C<-foo> as one use of C<-f> and two of
C<-o>.
So the processing looks for C<sub f{...}> and C<sub o{...}>.
If they are defined, they are called. Otherwise,
you will find C<$options{'f'} == 1>, and C<$options{'o'} == 2> in
the calling package.

Now, if this was not sufficiently complicated, immagine if you executed C<example.pl>
as C<example.pl -fad>. C<-fad> is an unregistered, short option. So, in addition to
complaints about C<-f> and C<-d> not being registered options (see L</Option Errors>),
C<sub add> will be executed because of the default processing for C<-fad>. You can 
use L</Tracing> to follow the workings of this case. One more thing. Because C<-fad>,
C<-f> and C<-d> did not have an associated subs, they will all show up in C<@ARGV>.

All of this complexity may be avoided by selecting the L</Configuration> option 
C<nobundle>.

=head2 Invalid Options

Options, (short or long) that 
are not registered 
are unshifted into C<@ARGV>.
There will also be an error message. See L</Option Errors>.
Bare "options" are indistinguishable from command-line data, so they can't
be flagged as errors.

=head2 Advanced Usage

=head3 Configuration

C<Getopt::Auto> may be invoked with an hash ref. These are the recognized keys,
also referred to as "Configuration Options". Note that I<with the exception of init>
all of the options are I<global>, in the sense that they are executed processing the
command line so in which module they might have been specified is irrelevant.

=over 4

=item *

C<noshort =E<gt> 1> - Ignore short options

=item *

C<nolong =E<gt> 1> - Ignore long options

=item *

C<nobare =E<gt> 1> - Ignore bare options

=item *

C<nobundle =E<gt> 1> - Don't de-group short options

=item *

C<nohelp =E<gt> 1> - Don't provide help for unregistered options

=item *

C<oknotreg =E<gt> 1> - Do not complain if unregistered options are found on the command line

=item *

C<okerrors =E<gt> 1> - Do not exit if there are errors parsing C<@ARGV>)

=back

=over 4

=item *

C<init =E<gt> \&your_sub> - Called before processing command line

This subroutine will be called by C<Getopt::Auto> in the C<INIT> block
before it scans the command line
for options. If multiple packages are involved, the init subroutines are executed in
the order processed by Perl.

=item *

C<findsub =E<gt> 1> - Enable using unegistered options

If C<--foo> is not registered but there is a C<sub foo{...}>, it will be called.
This implies C<oknotreg =E<gt> 1> .

=item *

C<trace =E<gt> 1> - Enable tracing.

=back

=head3 Restricted

If an option style is turned off by one of C<noshort>, C<nolong> or C<nobare>, it is referred to
as I<restricted>.

=head3 Tracing

Setting the environment variable C<GETOPT_AUTO_TRACE> to 1 with cause C<Getopt::Auo>
to trace its actions to C<STDOUT>. If you say C<trace =E<gt> 1> in the configuration hash, 
this overrides C<GETOPT_AUTO_TRACE>. To turn off tracing from the shell, set
C<GETOPT_AUTO_TRACE> to 0. 

=head3 Debugging

C<Getopt::Auto> runs before your script starts. So what if you need to debug it?
You will notice several lines in the code:

    #$DB::single = 2;      ## no critic (ProhibitPackageVars)

Delete the '#' to have the Perl debugger stop at that point. So why are these lines
commented out? So you won't have to step over them when debugging your script.

Despite this, when you load your script in the Perl debugger, you will see:

    _parse_args();

Why is this? Because this part of C<Getopt::Auto> is actually the first part of your
script, as it's in the C<INIT> block.
At this point, you're in F<Getopt/Auto.pm>, not the file you're attempting to debug.
So, just enter 'c' to continue from the C<INIT> block,
and you're on your way. 
To set breakpoints in your code, either use the Perldb C<f> command to move focus to the
appropriate source file, or use the Perldb commands 
C<n> or C<r>, which will take you to the first executable
statement in the code that B<use>s C<Getopt::Auto>. 
Sorry for the inconvenience.

=head3 Extended Example

Check out F<scripts/tour.pl> in the distribution for an extended example.

=head2 Help and Version

C<Getopt::Auto> automatically provides C<help> and C<version> options,
following  the style (long, short or bare) that is (numerically) the most common
in the POD or the B<use> statement. And if there's no POD? Then the default is
to recognize C<--help> and C<--version>.

C<help> and C<version> are output to STDERR.

C<--help> lists the commands available and the short help messages. If a
C<--help --option> is given for a option with L</Long Help>, the
longer message will be printed instead. Of course options discovered by C<findsub> 
won't appear.

C<--version> displays your program name, plus C<VERSION>. This
means you must set C<$VERSION = whatever> in your application.
(It's not a problem if you don't).
C<Getopt::Auto> gets this by scanning the calling package for the first occurrence
of C<$VERSION>, and then extracts a version number matching C<[\d\.]+>.
If you have another standard, well ....

The help function will C<exit 0> after execution.

    example.pl --help

    This is example.pl version 1.0

    example.pl -a - Add integer to count.
    example.pl --add - Add integer to count. [*]
    example.pl --help - This text
    example.pl --inc - Bump count by 1
    example.pl --version - Prints the version number

    More help is available on the topics marked with [*]
    Try example.pl --help --foo
    This is the built-in help, exiting

Suppose you want to have your own C<--help> and/or C<--version>? An obvious way to do the
would be to check C<$options{'--help'}> in your script. Regrettably, there's a conflict
between this way of doing things and the built-in help. However, if you create a C<sub help{...}>
instead, it will work fine.

L<Pod::Usage> does a nice job of turning your POD into help.

Here's a simple usage().

=over 4

    sub usage {
        pod2usage( -verbose => 2 );
        exit 0;
    }

=back

=head1 ERRORS

C<Getopt::Auto> tries not to complain, but sometimes life is just too hard!
Output is to STDERR. 

=head2 From use Getopt::Auto

These happen when the C<import> method has a problem.
No additional processing by C<Getopt::Auto> takes place.
C<Getopt::Auto> will C<exit 1> before parsing the POD.

=over 4

=item *

Getopt::Auto: Option specification [list element] should be a reference

We need either a reference to an HASH or ARRAY.

=item *

Getopt::Auto: Option list is incompletely specified

It needs 4 elements. See L</use Getopt::Auto([...])>.

=item *

Getopt::Auto: Must be use-d with: no args, an HASH ref or an ARRAY ref

Whatever you said, it wasn't one of these.

=item *

Getopt::Auto: Option E<lt>optionE<gt> is unknown

You've said something like C<use Getopt::Auto({foobar=>1})>,
and we don't know about C<foobar>.

=back

=head2 From C<@ARGV> Processing

If there are any errors in this phase, C<Getot::Auto> will C<exit 1>
at the end of processing I<unless> you have set the L</Configuration>
option C<okerror>. The number of errors may be obtained by calling
C<Getopt::Auto::get_errors> (which is not exported).

=over 4

=item *

Getopt::Auto: E<lt>optionE<gt> is not a registered option

C<Getopt::Auto> has found E<lt>optionE<gt> (C<--foobar>) on the command line, but you did 
not make it a L</Registered Option>. If this is the way you like to do things, you need to 
C<use Getopt::Auto({oknotreg=>1}).

If you have an unregistered option, you will also get help, if it is available.
This means the subroutine that you specified for --help, for -h or the builtin
help if neither are available. To avoid all of this, say C<use Getopt::Auto({nohelp=>1}).

Getopt::Auto: E<lt>optionE<gt> (from E<lt>some optionE<gt>) is not a registered option

C<Getopt::Auto> has found E<lt>optionE<gt> (C<-foo>) on the command line, but you did 
not make it a L</Registered Option>.
However, there were some subs defined, so there was partial execution.
Notice that the example refers to a I<short> option, as this situation can only
happen there. Suppose you defined C<sub o{...}> but not C<sub foo{...}>.
The default processing for a short option that does not have an associated sub is
to examine the individual letters. In this case, C<sub o{...}> was found, and 
executed. The error message will report C<-f> from C<-foo> as unregistered.

Again, if this is the way you like to do things, you need to 
C<use Getopt::Auto({oknotreg=>1}).

=item *

Getopt::Auto: To use E<lt>optionE<gt> with "=", a subroutine must be provided

The only way to interpret "--foo=24" is that a sub foo{...} exists that will
extract "24" from C<@ARGV>.

=back

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

C<Getopt::Auto> may be B<require>d, but as it depends on Perl calling its
C<import()> subroutine to process arguments to the statement, none of these
will work. Of course, if you use C<import Getopt::Auto> as well, all will be well.

In version 1.0, the option subroutine is called after the program exits
(in the C<END> block) with the contents of C<@ARGV> at that point as parameters.
C<Getopt::Auto> then exits, meaning that only one option subroutine can be
processed.

In the present version, the option subroutines are called
called I<before> program execution begins (in the C<INIT> block).
The subroutine is called with no parameters. Rather, it is expected
to inspect C<@ARGV> and remove whatever it uses. Multiple 
option subroutine calls are supported.

In the C<END> block, the 1.0 code executes main::default()
if that subroutine is present. This has been retained for compatibility, but will be 
removed in future versions unless someone makes a fuss.
