1.9.0 Thu Dec  3 16:42:08 PST 2009
    Completed according to original intent of incomplete
    version 1.0. Version is '1.9.0' in anticipation of going to
    2.0 when bugs are worked out.

1.9.1 Sun Jan 10 15:49:08 PST 2010
    Builtin help does not exit 0. Change 'exists' to 'defined' in test

    Windows failure in test t/02-internals_magic.t

    Failures of Spec build on 5.6.x and 5.8.1 Perls
    Mis-application of each() (see `perldoc -f each`). Result is random.

1.9.2 Thu Jul  1 16:06:58 PDT 2010
    Remove _ from _test_option so that perlcritic does not complain.
    It is, after all, intended for external use.
    Fix bug where command line with _no_ options, but args caused
    objection. In process made the default option type BARE.

1.9.3 Tue Oct  5 11:27:02 PDT 2010
    Add automatic help for unregistered options, so that you can
    avoid having to run the program a second time with --help (or
    is that -h? Oh, bother!)

1.9.4 Wed Dec 22 15:25:28 PST 2010
    Added comments.
    Tue Jul 26 20:13:22 PDT 2011
    Repair for 69822 (=begin/=end stopwords need blank lines)

1.9.5 Tue Jul 26 20:55:31 PDT 2011
    Fixed un-commented DB::
    Added example for uage()
